# textsummarization
Text Summarization using Machine learning. In this project, I took a small dataset & I try an extractive Approach.

In order words, we are talking about employing machines to perform the summarization of a document or documents using some form of heuristics or statistical methods. A summary in this case is a shortened piece of text which accurately captures and conveys the most important and relevant information contained in the document or documents we want summarized. Extractive text summarization methods function by identifying the important sentences or excerpts from the text and reproducing them verbatim as part of the summary. No new text is generated; only existing text is used in the summarization process.

I have used glove in this project.
